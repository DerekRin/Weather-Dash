# Weather-Dash

Wheather Dash is a website made with HTML and JavaScript!
It's main purpose is to help show the forecast for a city.

You enter a city name into the city box.

Afterwards you'll see the forecast for today!

As well as this week!

There is an issue where it'll occasionaly display the UV as 0.
This is an API issue, not a coding issue.
